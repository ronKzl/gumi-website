~Instructions~

1. Place pictures in public folder and reference them from there.
2. If you want lazy loading on some of the pictures reference the location in the data-src atrribute instead of the src one
and make sure both the 'lazy' and 'loading' classes are applied
3. Font sizes, font family, scroll bar settings and all colors used in project are found in styles.css change them there. 
    (The default displayed color pallete is dark mode.)
4. To properly change to a font family make sure you import the font/reference a cdn link in both html files then adjust css apropriately.
5. Nav Links are empty place desired link in the href attribute.

Removed:
No picture in the nav - it just breaks on desktop view idk how to fix
You don't need to click on the page to enter it - removed because this sucks balls on mobile to have to click the page.

On Gallery page:
Added Side padding for large/curved desktops - better compatibility with more devices that way
